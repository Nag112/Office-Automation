    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	1.FTP Client (suggested implementation: web, desktop or CLI app).
Build a simple FTP client. As a bonus challenge, support secure file transfer.<br/><br/>

2.HTTP Server (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). To understand HTTP deeply, build an HTTP server. There are a number of tutorials available to guide you through the process.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3.Build a simple operating system (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). This is a project that is technically challenging and will deepen your understanding of how computers and operating systems work. You might wish to start with the free (and cleverly named) book, Operating Systems: From 0 to 1.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 4.Build a web scraper (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool that takes a URL as input and returns the content of the URL as HTML or XML.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 5.Bandwidth monitor (suggested implementation: live updating CLI tool). Build a tool to track how much data you have downloaded or uploaded on the internet. Have it email you a weekly report of your usage. As a bonus challenge, predict peak usage times.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 6.Implement a cipher (suggested implementation: any programming language you want to master). Build a tool that takes a string of text as input and encrypts it using a cipher, such as the Caesar cipher.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 7.Create a text message downtime alerter (suggested implementation: app hooked up to the Twilio API for sending text messages). Create an app that takes a URL as input and sends you a text message when a request to the URL returns a response code other than 200 (OK).</div>
